# TorchRotor-RANS v0.3 — Rotating actuator-line trial

This version couples rotating blade-element forces to the existing single-phase PyTorch k–epsilon flow solver. Angular speed is prescribed. It computes aerodynamic shaft torque and mechanical power; it does not solve blade surfaces, rotor-speed dynamics, a generator or electrical power.

## Trial and input provenance

- 23 turbines on the existing terrain, 10 m/s inlet, density 1.225 kg/m³ and kinematic viscosity 1.5e-5 m²/s.
- Domain: 4096 × 2048 × 512 m. Uniform Cartesian spacing: 8 m; 512 × 256 × 64 cells, including 5,321,913 fluid cells.
- The initial velocity, k and epsilon fields are transferred from the completed v0.2 actuator-disc run at 600 s. The new model-transition trial has its own 0–30 s clock, saved every 0.2 s. This is not an already-converged ALM solution.
- Three straight rigid actuator lines per turbine, with 16 radial blade elements per line.
- Blade chord, twist and airfoil polars come from the public OpenFAST/r-test NREL 5 MW reference inputs, revision dd5feaaaa500ba7283140107806300d551cff0a7. Raw input files, Apache licence and file hashes are retained with the run.
- Span and chord are scaled from reference radius 63 m to each scene rotor radius (approximately 41.1 m). The reference hub-radius fraction is 1.5/63. Sweep and prebend are omitted. These are reference-derived surrogate blades, not identified specifications for the scene turbines.
- Prescribed tip-speed ratio: 7 relative to the 10 m/s inlet; pitch: zero degrees. Omega=7 U_in/R, approximately 16.28 rpm. No controller or shaft-inertia equation determines this speed.
- Polar tables are interpolated linearly in angle of attack and used at their supplied reference conditions. There is no Reynolds-number correction, dynamic stall, explicit tip-loss correction, elastic deformation or section pitching-moment model.
- Ct=0.95 is not used to calculate ALM forces. Thrust now follows from blade-element lift and drag.
- New forces are ramped over the first 5 s. This is a numerical model-transition choice.

## Rotating blade aerodynamics

At radial position r and azimuth theta, the point position and blade velocity are:

    X = hub + r e_r(theta)
    theta(t) = theta_0 + Omega t
    v_blade = Omega r e_t,   e_t = n × e_r
    w = u_interpolated(X) − v_blade

The local two-dimensional section velocity uses w_n=w·n and w_t=w·e_t. Radial flow is omitted from the section aerodynamic calculation.

    W² = w_n² + w_t²
    phi = atan2(w_n, −w_t)
    alpha = phi − twist − pitch
    dL = 0.5 rho W² c Cl(alpha) dr
    dD = 0.5 rho W² c Cd(alpha) dr

Lift is perpendicular to relative section velocity; drag points along that relative velocity. The force on the fluid is opposite to the blade force. This provides axial and tangential momentum forcing, allowing aerodynamic torque and wake swirl.

    T = sum(F_blade · n)
    Q = sum((X−hub) × F_blade) · n
    P_aero = Q Omega

P_aero is aerodynamic mechanical power at prescribed speed. It is not electrical generation, rated power, or an actual-site performance prediction.

## Grid coupling and equations

Velocity components are stored on MAC cell faces, with pressure, k and epsilon at cell centres. The solver advances incompressible momentum and standard k–epsilon transport:

    div(u) = 0
    du/dt + div(u ⊗ u) = −grad(pi) + div(tau_eff) + f_ALM/rho
    nu_t = Cmu k²/epsilon
    dk/dt + div(u k) = div((nu + nu_t/sigma_k) grad(k)) + Pk − epsilon
    d(epsilon)/dt + div(u epsilon)
      = div((nu + nu_t/sigma_epsilon) grad(epsilon))
        + Cepsilon1 (epsilon/k) Pk − Cepsilon2 epsilon²/k

Constants are Cmu=0.09, Cepsilon1=1.44, Cepsilon2=1.92, sigma_k=1 and sigma_epsilon=1.3. Transport uses finite-volume first-order upwind advection and centred diffusion. A pressure Poisson solve with PCG and geometric multigrid enforces discrete continuity. No trained weights are used.

Blade velocities are interpolated directly from the three staggered velocity components. Each component uses a Gaussian kernel with sigma=sqrt(2) times the grid spacing (approximately 11.31 m), truncated at 3 sigma. Masked faces are excluded. An affine moment correction imposes unit total weight and zero first moment about the blade point. The same weights are used for interpolation and force spreading, preserving discrete work exchange. Corrected weights can be signed near masks; they are not clipped after correction.

This broad kernel is a coarse-grid regularisation. The 8 m grid does not resolve blade surfaces or establish accurate tip-vortex dynamics. The moment correction is an implementation choice and has not been validated against a reference ALM solver.

Time steps satisfy the flow stability estimate and an additional blade-motion bound: no more than 0.25 cell lengths of tip travel or 0.1 rad azimuth per step. Forces are evaluated at the time-step midpoint. Force, moment and work conservation are checked against the actual scattered face forces at saved samples.

## Boundaries and terrain

The terrain, towers and nacelles retain the existing voxel solid masks and k–epsilon wall-function treatment. The inlet is fixed at 10 m/s, with the v0.2 inlet turbulence assumptions (I=0.3%, L approximately 5.303 m). The outlet uses zero projection pressure and extrapolated transport fields; sides and top are slip boundaries. These are exploratory terrain-flow approximations.

## Animation and interpretation

The animation shows Ux on a slice 80 m above terrain. Missing terrain and invalid samples stay masked. The colour scale saturates at ≤0 and ≥20 m/s. The original decorative blade meshes are replaced by the rotating actuator lines, using the same axis, radial basis and recorded phase as the solver. Playback defaults to one physical second per real second; recorded phase is not slowed independently.

The inherited rotor-speeds file is retained only for viewer compatibility: in this version its values are mean blade-sampled axial velocities, not area-averaged disc speeds. Recorded angular velocities and phases are stored separately in rotor-kinematics.json.

This is a short coupling trial, not a validated reproduction or a grid-independent prediction. Water, waves, floating-body motion, moorings, structural flexibility, rotor acceleration, electrical generation and control are outside this implementation.

## Completed numerical trial

The 30 s run completed 1050 time steps and 151 saved frames. Maximum relative errors in force, global moment and work exchange were 6.79e-08, 2.18e-08 and 4.42e-08, respectively.

At the final sample, total thrust was 6.860 MN, total aerodynamic shaft torque 36.007 MN m, and aerodynamic mechanical power 61.373 MW across 23 surrogate rotors. These are unvalidated outputs of a coarse, prescribed-speed trial, not electrical generation. The inherited ADM run's finite-window stationarity result does not establish stationarity of the new ALM trial.
